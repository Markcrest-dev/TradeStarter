## ✅ **WHAT WAS DONE:**

   - It detaches from the top, centers itself, and gains rounded corners.
   - **Dark Mode:** Added a subtle glow effect to the pill in dark mode for a premium look.

2. **Multi-Language Expansion:**
   - Added support for **French (fr)**, **German (de)**, and **Chinese (zh)**.
   - Updated the language selector across **all 16 HTML pages**.

3. **Consistent Design:**
   - The new design and language options are applied globally to ensure a unified user experience.
